## My process

This is the last and the biggest project I made through using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It was very challenging especially the part where you must always think about how the project is gonna work and look in different browsers and device.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned in this project is that it is very important to always think how the project is gonna work and look in different browsers and device. We must optimize everything especially the images used before deployment.
